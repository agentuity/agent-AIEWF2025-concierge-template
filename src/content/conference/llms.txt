## Privacy Policy Overview
# Privacy Policy

At React Miami, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that are collected and recorded by React Miami and how we use it.

## What is personal data?

Personal data means any information regarding to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes, for example, your name, phone number, address, and email address.

## What personal data do we collect?

We collect personal data about you from a variety of sources, such as:

### Information we collect directly from you

This is the personal data you provide us when using our Services. For example when you sign up to receive our newsletter, opt in to be added to the delegate list, register to attend an Event, or when you create an account. This type of information may include your name, email address, username, telephone number, date of birth, address, user-generated content, post and other content you submit to our Services, and any other information you provide voluntarily to us. The profile information that you choose to provide to React Miami (or third-party networking application you've opted into during the Event) might be accessible to other attendees of the Event, subject to your settings.

We may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information when you use our online services and interact with our online advertisements. This type of information may include your type of browser or device, details of the web pages you have viewed, links you clicked on, your IP address, sites clicked on before coming to our websites, and any other information you choose to share when using the “Like” functionality on Facebook. For more information on cookies and how to manage them, please see our Cookie Statement.

We may use information from a social sign-on using your Facebook or LinkedIn credentials to create an account or log on. This type of information may include your title, company, interests, and other information you authorize.

### Information we collect via scanning

React Miami provides attendees with a third-party networking application for the purpose of making connections with other attendees. For example, the profile information provided by you to React Miami will be accessible to other attendees of an Event, subject to your settings in the third party networking application.

The QR code scanning functionality on the Event badge is activated by default. You can provide your profile information to other attendees and partners by allowing them to scan the QR code on your Event badge at the Event and you may be able to create a mutual networking connection via an in-app function on the third-party networking application with another attendee or partner. Your data will only be shared with your consent to the sharing of your contact information with an attendee or partner via the third-party networking application. Consent may be revoked at any time.

### Information we collect from other sources

We may collect information from other sources if you have given permission for that information to be shared. For example information from your social media accounts, public databases and marketing companies. This type of information may include your name, postal address, telephone number, email address, household information, consumer and market research data, purchase behavior and preferences, and information about your lifestyle such as your hobbies and interests. The aforementioned processing of personal data may also be based on the legitimate interests of React Miami.

### For which purposes do we use your personal data?

We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:

- Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.
- Where you have consented to the processing which consent may be revoked at any time.
- Where you have made the information manifestly public.
- Where necessary in the public interest.
- Where necessary to protect your vital interest.

The following purposes are examples of how we may use the personal data we collect:

- Provide access to networking applications, facilitate information sharing with other attendees and partners with your consent and provide you with relevant connections and content during the Event;
- Determine the popularity of certain sessions and content during an Event;
- Provide you with Services that you request from us;

- Store your preferences for future interactions and communications from us;
- Create external marketing & analytics reports;

- Prevent illegal activities, suspected fraud and potential threats to our network; and
- Analyse the characteristics of our customers at an aggregated level and customer utilization of our Services in order to understand customer and market needs, to improve our existing Services, to design new Services, and for business development.

### Will we share your personal data with other parties?

We may disclose your personal data to third parties if needed to provide the Services, which third parties will process your personal data in conformance with this Privacy Statement.

We may also disclose your personal data:

- To our affiliates or subsidiaries.
- If we are legally entitled or required to do so (for example, if required to do so by legal proceedings or for the purposes of detection and prevention of fraud and other crime or as part of a security audit).
- When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety, or the safety of others.
- If we sell a business or part of a business to another company then the transfer of ownership could include the transfer of your personal data directly related to that business to the purchasing company. We would require the buyer to treat your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
- To any third party in order to fulfill the agreement between you and React Miami.
- To any other third party (for example speakers, sponsoring companies, and other attendees at the Event) with your prior permission to do so.

Your personal data may be transferred, stored, and processed in the United States or any other country in which React Miami (or its affiliates, subcontractors or agents) maintain facilities. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement and applicable data protection law and legislation.

Security

## Building Scalable Access Control Frameworks in React

As applications scale in complexity, managing user permissions becomes a growing challenge. Without a structured approach, permissions quickly become a tangled mess of if-else statements, leading to poor maintainability and scalability.

While Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provides a strong starting point for managing user access, it is not recommended by OWASP and may not offer the level of granularity needed as your app evolves. In this session, we’ll explore two practical approaches to building scalable permissions systems in React.

First, I’ll introduce CASL, a popular ABAC library that simplifies fine-grained access control. Then, I’ll guide you through building a custom permissions system, tailored to your app’s needs. Throughout the session, I'll conduct detailed code walkthroughs for both approaches, covering key concepts like state management, custom hooks, and caching/conditional queries using Redux Toolkit.

By the end, you'll have the tools to implement a clean and scalable permission systems in React, whether using a pre-built solution or building your own.

## About

Brooks is the Developer Relations Manager for the Remix team at Shopify.

Starting with a career in Data Science, Brooks quickly fell into web development because it was the best way to connect people to the tools he was building. From complex simulations to grocery stores, he has always cared about building products that give people the information they need to make a good decision.

Brooks also cares deeply about educating and building communities in a way that is approachable to people at every skill level, but doesn't leave theme there.

As Dev Rel for the Remix team, Brooks is able to influence the direction of Remix and React Router to be the tool he needed when he first started. He also gets to support the Remix community by ensuring it is a welcoming place where developers can flourish.

Routing

## Why File-based Routing Sucks and Why You Should Use It

File-based routing sucks. Or maybe the Remix team just sucks at coming up with good conventions. The v2 "flat routes" were supposed to make things better, yet time and time again it is cited as the reason people give up on the framework. Looking around at the landscape, there doesn't seem to be a single file-based routing system that is universally liked. Even Next.js's App Router isn't without it's critics. In this talk we will explore why every convention kind of sucks, what we've done about that with React Router, and why you should probably still use file-based routing.

Performance

## DevTools & The Performance Tab

“Firebug basically exists for two reasons: one is to show what's going on on your page when it loads, the other is to show you what happens after the page loads”. Firebug, the original devtools, was seen as a big step in website debugging. In fact, it was called "web development evolved". The evolution of the web eventually required an evolution in debugging and ultimately, advancements in browser devtools. We moved from the ability to observe what happens during, and after a page load, to determining user experience as well as render blocking interactions.

“DevTools & The Performance Tab” is a presentation about how browser devtools provide a powerful ability to debug, specifically with web performance in mind.

Web Server

## Serving content on the web: from PHP to RSC—and beyond

The role of the web server has changed a lot over the last few generations of web development tooling. We'll look at how, and why it matters.

We'll talk about where web applications can request data from, how that data are sent to the browser, and how these things can affect the performance your end user sees. We'll talk about network latency, round trips, CDNs, and how modern tools like Next, Remix and TanStack Start can empower you to create the best possible experience for your users—if you use them right.

Error Handling

## Throw Try/Catch in the 🗑️ Level up your React error handling with the Result type

Tired of guessing if that imported function throws, or maybe you’re losing sleep from being paged for an unhanded promise rejection at 2am? Error handling is insidiously difficult to get right in React and TypeScript.

This talk introduces the Result type - a simple, powerful, and pragmatic game-changer for managing errors in React applications. We'll explore how to leverage Result types in conjunction with React's Error & Suspense Boundaries to create more robust, type-safe, and maintainable code.

Say goodbye to unexpected crashes and hello to graceful, typed, and exhaustive error management that your future self (and your team) will thank you for.

Fullstack

## The Upsidedown Stack: React on the Server and Postgres in the Browser

The full stack is now the upsidedown stack. We are habituated to the traditional architecture of a frontend app making an API request to a backend server, which makes a request to a database. At minimum, you have multiple round trips of requests adding hundreds of milliseconds, if not whole seconds.

With recent developments in React with server components and with databases with local-first tools like pglite, you can flip the full stack upsidedown and no longer be limited network latency!

Components

## I Can't Believe It's Not JS

When it comes to building interactive features on a webpage, JavaScript is usually the way to go. However, with great JavaScript dependencies comes great website instability. Even a minor undefined element can cause your entire webpage to crash. That’s where going back to the basics come in. Thanks to modern Web APIs, it’s now possible to reduce JavaScript dependency on a website by swapping out JS components for their native HTML element or CSS feature counterparts.

In this talk, we’ll take a look at how to use HTML and CSS to build simpler alternatives to popular JavaScript components such as accordions, modals, scroll transitions, carousels etc. We’ll also take a look at the performance and accessibility benefits and real life applications and use-cases of these components.

Sync Engines

## Making React Fun Again, with Sync Engines

React won because it was a dramatically more enjoyable way to build UI. But in search of performance, React has accumulated tons of complexity, losing much of its original simple appeal. Sync engines are the fix. They enable absurdly fast – literally instant – UI, but also recapture a lot of the simple joy from React’s first days. Join me to explore several emerging sync engines, and learn how to use them in your next project.
